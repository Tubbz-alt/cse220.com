			<h1>Sparky</h1>
			<div>
				<h2>Introduction to Sparky</h2>
				<p>Sparky is a UNIX operating system, specifically SunOS version 5.10.</p>
				<p>Sparky will be how you submit your assignments this semester.</p>
				
				<h2>Accessing Sparky</h2>
				<p>Sparky is hosted on the school's servers. You will be given credentials to login to Sparky over the SSH (Secure SHell) protocol.</p>
				<p>Sparky can accessed via two different URLs:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>sparky.ic.stonybrook.edu</li>
					<li>sparky.ic.sunysb.edu</li>
				</ul>
				<p>To sign into Sparky, open your command line program and enter the following:</p>
<pre class="cli"><span class="prmpt">sean@laptop</span> [<span class="dir">~</span>] $ ssh -p 24 NETID@sparky.ic.stonybrook.edu</pre>
				<p>You will be prompted to enter your password. No text will appear while you type it. After you enter your password you must hit enter once more to get past a welcome screen. Once in your prompt will look like the following:</p>
<pre class="cli">sparky%</pre>
				
				<h2>Using the Shell</h2>
				<p>Sparky uses csh (C SHell) by default. We can confirm this by printing out the SHELL environment variable. To confirm, we <span class="cmd">echo</span> it to standard out:</p>
<pre class="cli">sparky% echo $SHELL
/bin/csh
sparky%</pre>
				<p>Sparky also has bash (Bourne Again SHell) available. As bash is the default shell on macOS and many versions of Linux, it is the recommended shell to use. It also supports more actions than csh which will improve your experience on Sparky. To launch bash from csh, type <span class="cmd">bash</span> at the command line.</p>
<pre class="cli">sparky% bash
bash-3.2$</pre>
				<h2>Submitting Homework on Sparky</h2>
				<p>To submit on Sparky, run the following program:
<pre class="cli">sparky% ~cse220/submit</pre>
				<p>Follow the ensuing prompts. The line count for your homework submission may vary by one line as a timestamp is appended to your homework file. Do not be concerned unless the line count reported varies by more than one line.</p>
